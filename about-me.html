    Hi there! I'm Ann, a legal professional turned software engineer. 
    It all started with my BSc Law Degree, but fate had other plans as I stumbled upon my true passion for Fintech while running my own successful eCommerce venture.

    A pivotal turning point came when I was sponsored by Zopa Bank Ltd for an intensive software engineer nano degree program. 
    Through this rigorous course, I honed my skills in Python and SQL, paving the way for an exciting opportunity as a junior software engineer at Zopa.

    Sharing knowledge and empowering others is an essential aspect of my journey. 
    As a lead instructor with Code First Girls, I've been guiding students through Python and SQL courses, witnessing their growth and enthusiasm firsthand.

    The fusion of my legal background, fintech expertise, relentless curiosity, and passion defines my unique approach to problem-solving and innovation. 
    I am thrilled at the prospect of channeling these attributes to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to your team, creating forward-thinking solutions that redefine the fintech landscape.
